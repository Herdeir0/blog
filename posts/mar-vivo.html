          Drive southwest enough from any point in Europe and you will find
          Sagres, a centenary portugese village where the sea is still king.<br />
          Its location, surrounded by letal high cliffs and strong sea currents,
          is place to one of Portugal's most important militar stronghold,
          <a>Fortaleza de Sagres</a>.<br />
          But that's not what I decided to capture with my lens. Instead I
          focused on other life that you can find around Sagres. A centuries old
          lighthouse, people adventuring through life daring cliffs. Uniquely
          shaped rocky formations fighting the sea right below them, and humans
          that make the sea and what's whithin it, their payroll.<br />
          Mar Vivo, or Living Sea, is my way of presenting a lifestyle that has
          been around for milleniums, fishermanship.

          I decided to start the video with the opening scene of a lighthouse. A
          building that guides boats to safety seemed to me like a great way to
          start a video that would later showcase said fisherman's boats tied up
          at the docks, their safe place.<br />
          The lighthouse that you see here is the
          <a>Farol do Cabo de S. Vicente</a>, from there, you can observe the
          next two shots: Two imposing cliffs, one easily reachable by foot,
          where people can be seen gathering and admiring the view, and the
          other one empty due to its hard-to-reach, and dangerously steep
          location.<br />

          <img src="../imgs/posts/mar-vivo-cliff-2.png" />
          Slowly, we start descending our view into the sea that is dozens of
          meters below us. The first shot's background is only sky, the second
          shot shows a roughly fifthy percent ratio between sky and sea, and
          finally the third shot doesn't have any sky on it, only sea. Then,
          finally, our first time looking at the sea on the frontground.<br />
          <img src="../imgs/posts/mar-vivo-sea.png" />
          It's during this fourth shot that we start seeing movement, a concept
          that will persist until the end of the piece, with exception to some
          shots deliberately still. During this scene, you can finally testify
          the nature of the sea that you knew was all around us, but haven't yet
          had the chance to experience.<br />
          For the next shot, we are no longer near the Farol. We moved like
          seaguls, from the sea to the docks. The next sights are tools of man.
          Objects that represent the work that is done on the docks. Traps for
          fish and crab, pallets to move the catch. An ordinary sight to the
          ones that use everyday but a delightful pattern for the ones that look
          for it. <br />
          Then, and finally, we see it. The one tool that makes fishing at sea
          what it is: Boats. We start with rudimental ones, simple boats that
          can carry four, maybe five, fishermans and respective tools. These are
          not meant for the open sea, they are the auxiliar boats that take our
          fisherman to the bigger vessel waiting to sail into the openness of
          the Atlantic.

          <img src="../imgs/posts/mar-vivo-boats-4.png" />
          And it's now, during the last third of the video, that we start
          witnessing a part of the craftsmanship. A man cleaning up his boat, a
          group untangling their nets.<br />
