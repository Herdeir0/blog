        <title>ðŸ’¡ Creating for the sake of creating</title>
        <p>
          A creative is, by definition, someone who creates, usually something,
          but from times to times, also nothing. What this
          <i>one</i> creates might be subject to question from others, but never
          from the creator itself. The creator creates what the creator wants
          to. What he or she or them envision that should be created, what
          should be done.<br />

            medium in which thoughts become reality, it's, above all, the reason
            why we can't have good things.</quote
